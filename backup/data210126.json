With him is\nSgt. James Murray, one of the ground staff who will service the plane.\nDelivery of the 200-miles-an-hour American-built Harvard means that the\nDuke's training has now progressed beyond the 120 m.p.h. Chipmunk in which\nhe received his initial flying lessons. When he masters the Harvard, he\nwill move on to jet planes - probably the 600-miles-an-hour Gloster Meteor.\n\nend\n\nFile: DUKE OF EDINBURGH X file training Planes."

It is due for completion in the summer of 1952,\nbut the Crude Oil Distillation Unit and its necessary\nauxiliaries are expected to be in commission in a few months.\nSituated at the Isle of Grain, on the Kent coast, the new\nrefinery will cost £40,000,000, and its output will be about\none-sixth of the Abadan refinery. It is being constructed\non reclaimed marshland on which a million tons of sand from\nthe sea bed off the Nore have been pumped in order to stop\nthe natural sinking of the land, and to prevent the sand\ndrifting, a mixture of grass and clover has been planted.\nNew jetties are under construction to accommodate the largest\nof tankers, and there will be 160 storage tanks.\nThe picture shows:\n\n1983-5286/51756\n\nA view of the new refinery site looking south-east from\nCat.

How you are introduced to some of the people who are shaping the future of London in this article BY CONNERY CHAPPELL.\n\nJUST SHORT OF FORTY YEARS AGO, the Civic Ã¢â‚¬Å“planningÃ¢â‚¬Â of the future of London began in earnest with a plan for rebuilding London. A forty-seven-million-pound scheme, by Mr. Raymond Unwin, who was to do so much for town planning since that time. Since then, not only has she had ample space and publicity, but, rather more unfortunately, perhaps, private enterprise has had practically no record. It has been the most interesting of all the planning ventures, but practically all records of it have gone into a second edition as a batch of six, ten, 20, 30, 40, and 50 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ shilling volumes.

Now you are\nintroduced to some of the people who have been working for the future of\nLondon in this article by CONNERY CHAPPELL\n\nOHN HENRY FORSHAW, M.C., the ex-Royal\nEngineers officer, who is the chief man behind\nthe London County Council's Plan for rebuild-\ning London, is forty-seven and earns £2,750 a year.\nAnd while the Plan, to which he contributed more\nthan any one else has had more space and publicity\nthan any other single news item since the war started,\nForshaw himself has had practically none. Which is\nhow he prefers it.\n\nThe Plan, of course, has broken all records. It has\ngone into a second edition as a book at 12s. 6d. More\nthan 1,500 people a day have seen models of it at the\nCounty Hall—mostly housewives, service men on\nleave and young people who wanted to see the world\nof the future—there its exhibition has had to be ex-\ntended. Editorial comment on it runs into hundreds\nof columns.\n\nIn short, after taking two years to prepare, the Plan\nis revealed as the biggest thing of its type ever at-\ntempted.\n\nIt is a Plan, not of lines, but of lives, designed to\ntake the ugliness out of London, in the words of Lord\nLatham, Leader of the Council.\nThe decision to produce it was taken more than two\nyears ago, during the big air raids. A special staff\nwas built up from people in the Town Planning Sec-\ntion of the L.C.C.'s big architectural department at\nCounty Hall.\nEvery one concerned with it carried on with their\n\nnormal Civil Defence and Home Guard duties, and\noften with their departmental work as well. There were\nno privileges, no special favours. It was an enormous\njob, frequently done under bad conditions during air\nraids.\n\nAs consultant, the L.C.C. engaged Leslie Patrick\nAbercrombie, Professor of Town Planning at Uni-\nversity College, London, who is accepted as Britain's\nleading expert on the subject. Wesley Dougill, who\ndied in February, when the job was nearly done, was\nAssistant Planning Officer, and did brilliant work.\n\nThe whole thing was produced on an informal con-\nference system, many meetings taking place in the\nearly hours of the morning during the hectic nights of\n1941.\n\nProfessor Abercrombie, who was visiting County\nHall several times a week, frequently stayed over and\nslept there, and Mr. Forshaw was usually on the spot—\nfor in addition to his position as deputy architect and\nlater architect to the council he was also in charge of\nA.R.P. rescue work and debris disposal for London.\n\nThis involved spending many nights at headquarters\nand it was during these sessions, waiting for air raid\nalerts, that a lot of the early theoretical work was done.\n\nGradually, the staff sorted itself out; it never\nexceeded thirty and averaged about twenty. It was\nenthusiastic, and young, which was as well, for an\nenormous amount of groundwork had to be cleared up\nbefore the Plan could reach the drawing boards.\nConsultations at what the council calls “officer\n\n    —4 SEP. 1943\n    ILLUSTRATED\n\nSTUDIO\nName\nDate 10-9-73\nFile"

        "Transcribed_Text": "THE FUR STORAGE\nVAULT\nwavy.\nBy CALLISTHENES\n\nThe other day a charming customer\nwho brought to our Fur Department\nseveral articles requiring immediate\nattention told us of an experience which\nmay be common to many. Last Spring,\nfeeling very economical and imagining\nthat the trifling cost of fur storage might\nbe avoided, the lady purchased a moth-\nproof bag, stored her furs therein and\nput the bag away. The receptacle,\nunfortunately, was not proof against\nthe tiny invader, for a carelessly folded\nopening admitted the enemy, with the\nresult that the lady’s furs can only be\nsaved by the immediate attention we\nare now giving them. For protection\nis not so much a matter of only moth-\nproof bags as the application of storage\nconditions that make damage\nimpossible.\n\nThe Fur Storage Vault of ours is a\nwell-known and enormously patronised\ndepartment of this business. We believe\nit to be one of the largest fur vaults\nof its kind in the world. It is so arranged\nthat its temperature is maintained\ncontinuously below freezing-point, so\nthat it becomes impossible for moth\neggs to germinate, even though they be\ndepply hidden in the fur. But this\nprecaution against germination is only\na single stage in a carefully planned\ncampaign against the insinuating moth.\nTwo or three times during the summer\nmonths—for an entire 24 hours—the\ntemperature of the vault is allowed to\nrise to that of the street. By this means\nwhatever eggs are left in the furs are\nencouraged to hatch out. The trouble-\nsome insects are then submitted to the\nfreezing process and eliminated utterly.\nIt has been noted, by the way, that pelts\ntreated by this process recover their\noriginal sheen, and seem rejuvenated\nafter their emergence from cold storage.\nCarefully examined before they are\nstowed away and no less carefully\nre-examined before being handed over,\nthe pelts return with a newness and a\nglossiness which is otherwise lost to\nthem. The cost of this work is so\nsmall—a matter, really, of a few shillings\n—as to represent the most profitable\noutlay on one’s wardrobe needs.\n\nWe have now arrived at a period of the\nyear when many of these gems of the furrier's\nart are being removed. Yet we feel that our\nreference to this fascinating subject is timely,\nif only for the moral it points. To incur\navoidable risk to precious furs in the hope\nof saving a few shillings for storage is to be\n“ penny wise, pound foolish ” in the widest\nsense of the phrase.\n\nSelfridge & Co., Ltd."

Archi-\ntectural Press, 45s.\nNot until one is open-\ned up and everybody\nthought there might be\nsome answer to the\ntraffic problem.\nWe had spent a year\nand a half on this\nstudy, of pedestrian\nand road traffic, with\nparking, street and\nBath would be that\ncould be done to\nreduce city traffic\nand improve conditions.\nWe came to the con-\nclusion that a drama-\ntic reduction in city\ntraffic could only be\ngained by having a\ntown which was con-\nceived from the be-\nginning to serve the\nneeds of people in the\nage of the motor car.\nThe Americans are now\ndoing this in the form\nof freeway systems that\ntake\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ÂThe futuristic town\nplanned to make\nthe best of motors\nby Malcolm MacEwen\nas editor of the Royal Institute of British Architects\nTwo ways to make the traffic\nproblem worse. One way is every\nleft turn, every right turn, because\nof an American affection for the\nleft-hand drive, and the other\nproblem is parking, and other than\nthe problems is traffic and not\nparking. This is probably the worst\nproblem for the town.\n\"Hellish-pie, now\" of\nMalvern, showing how the\nspace that would naturally\nbe taken up by congested\nroads is given over to parks\nand recreation grounds.\nIt is, A. Hilton, the architect,\nwho devised the layout for the\ntown, although the architect has\nmuch to recommend it.\nIts great merit is to be found\nin the idea of a town in which\nwe walk or drive. It is designed\nto work as an extension to the\nexisting town and its surround-\ning. However, it would be much\nmore simple if the town were\ntotally redesigned.\nThe first good point is the separ-\nation of traffic and pedestrians.\nThe new design shows that cars,\nbuses and vehicles are kept at\nthe ground level, while pedestri-\nans walk on elevated platforms.\nThis ensures that pedestrians\nare able to move about in the\ntown freely and safely, and there\nis no danger of being run over.\nAt the moment it is only the\nbeginning of a much needed\nrevolution in town design.\nThe second good point is the\nprovision of a great deal of\nparking space. This is provided\nat various levels, and some are\non the ground, some are in the\nmulti-story car parks, and some\nare on the rooftops. This ensures\nthat there is always plenty of\nspace for cars, and it is easy to\nfind a parking space. The roads\nhave been planned so that they\nare able to handle a much higher\nvolume of traffic than the old\nroads. They are wider and\nstraighter, and there are more\nlanes. This allows for a quicker\nflow of traffic, and fewer traffic\njams. At the moment it is a very\nbig problem in the town, where\ntraffic is always congested.\nThe third good point is the pro-\nvision of plenty of green space.\nThis is provided in the form of\nparks, gardens, and open spaces,\nand it is very important that we\nhave plenty of space in the town,\nwhere we can relax and enjoy the\ngreen. This also helps to make\nthe town more attractive.\nSHOPPING\nAt the side of the town is a\nlarge shopping centre. This is\nprovided with shops, restaurants,\nand other facilities, and it is a\nvery big problem for the town.\nThis also helps to make the town\nmore attractive. It is very im-\nportant that we have plenty of\nspace in the town, where we can\nrelax and enjoy the green. This\nalso helps to make the town more\nattractive. The shopping centre\nis connected to the town by a\nseries of pedestrian bridges, which\nallow people to move between the\nshopping centre and the town with-\nout having to cross roads. This\nalso helps to make the town more\naccessible, and allows people to\nmove about the town more freely.\nThe shopping centre is also con-\nnected to the multi-story car parks,\nso people can park their cars and\nthen walk directly into the shop-\nping centre. This makes it very\nconvenient for shoppers. It is\nalso connected to the public trans-\nport system, so people can come\nto the shopping centre by bus or\ntrain. This makes it very access-\nible for everyone.\nEXERCISE\nTo overcome Monopoly, Mr. House\nmade use of the futuristic town.\nThis is an exercise in the land-\nscape architecture of the new\ntown. It is designed to work in\nthe landscape and town. The\ngreen spaces of the town have\nbeen designed to create a variety\nof different landscapes, which in-\nclude forests, lakes, and rivers.\nThese are designed to be used\nfor a variety of activities, such\nas walking, cycling, and boating.\nWe shall see how the spaces in\nthe landscape architecture of the\nnew town are designed to create\na variety of different landscapes.\nWe have work to overcoming the\nproblem. Mr. House had to work\nhard to design a new town. He\nhad to work out how to make the\ntown attractive and functional.\nThis is a very big problem for the\ntown. This also helps to make the\ntown more attractive. It is very\nimportant that we have plenty of\nspace in the town, where we can\nrelax and enjoy the green. This\nalso helps to make the town more\nattractive. \"However,\" which is\nquite plausible and seems real-\nistic. The third good point is the\nprovision of plenty of green space.\nThis is provided in the form of\nparks, gardens, and open spaces,\nand it is very important that we\nhave plenty of space in the town,\nwhere we can relax and enjoy the\ngreen. This also helps to make\nthe town more attractive. \"This,\"\nit goes on to say, \"is a very\nimportant aspect of the town\ndesign, because it helps to cre-\nate a good quality of life for the\nresidents.\" \"The town,\" it con-\ncludes, \"is designed to be a place\nwhere people can live, work, and\nplay in a healthy and enjoyable\nenvironment.\" This is a very big\nproblem for the town. This also\nhelps to make the town more\nattractive. It is very important\nthat we have plenty of space in\nthe town, where we can relax and\nenjoy the green. This also helps\nto make the town more attractive.\n\"We,\" it goes on to say, \"are\nvery confident that the new town\nwill be a success, and that it\nwill provide a model for future\ntown planning.\"",

Studio\nBooks, 42s.\n\nNOT so long ago nearly\neverybody thought\nthat they knew the\nanswer to the traffic prob-\nlem.\n\nWe had only to spend a\nfew hundred millions a year\non motorways, ring roads,\nflyovers, road widenings and\nmulti-storey parking\ngarages, and Bob would (in\ndue course) be your uncle.\nThis innocent illusion, because\nsuccessive Governments have\nrefused to spend anything more\nthan small change on building\nroads, and we were unable to\nlearn from experience (as the\nAmericans are now doing) that\nthe engineering solution opens a\nbottomless financial pit, but\n\n—the futuristic town\n\nplanned to make\n\nthe best of motors\n\nby\nMalcolm MacEwen\n\nan official of the Royal Institute of British Architects\n\ndoes not solve the traffic\nproblem.\nTwo cars in every Los\nAngeles garage are a sign less\nof American affluence than of\nthe catastrophic collapse of\npublic transport, of waste on a\nvast scale, and of the dispersal\nof the city far and wide over\nthe countryside.\n“Motopia” is the name given\n\nby G. A. Jellicoe, the landscape\narchitect, architect and town-\nplanner, to his theoretical\ndesign for an ideal motorised\ntown.\n\nIts great merit is that he\nbreaks through the fetters of\nconventional thinking in an\neffort to design a new kind of\ntown in which we can get the\nbest of both worlds — the\nmobility of the motor car with-\nout its dirt, noise, smells, con-\nestion and danger.\n\nMotopia consists of a rect-\nangular grid of five-storey ter-\nraces, forming a series of great\nown “squares.”\n\nThe first four storeys are flats\nand maisonettes, some with gar-\nlens; the fifth storey is a\n“mews storey” for car parking\nand vehicular access; and the\nroads are on the roof, screened\nby plants.\n\nThe entire space between the\nbuildings, and under them, is a\nvast park of unending variety\nand beauty, in which lie schools\nand other public buildings, and\nthrough which one can walk\neverywhere in safety.\n\nAt the corner of each square\nthe buildings form a hollow\ncircle, containing local shops\nand other facilities on the\nground floor, and a roundabout\nfor the rooftop road.\n\nSHOPPING\n\nAt one side of the town is a\ngreat multi-level, glassed-in\nshopping centre, where people\nmeet for shopping and pleasure\nafter parking their cars on the\nroof.\n\nIt is easy to criticise Mr. Jel-\nlicoe’s conception. It is a shot\nin the dark because nobody has\nyet done the basic studies on\ntraffic generation that would\nenable us to discover the practi-\ncal limits to the use of the motor\ncar in towns.\n\nAll we do know is that large\ntowns and cities, if they are to\n\n“Helicopter-view” of\nMotopia, showing how the\nspace that would normally\nbe taken up by congested\nroads is given over to parks\nand recreation grounds.\n\nremain reasonably compact\ngroupings for social intercourse,\nmust depend largely on public\ntransport.\nIn Motopia, this is limited to\nwater buses on the lakes—\ndelightful, but of limited prac-\ntical value.\n\nTo put the traffic on the roof\nand the people on the ground is\nobviously more difficult than the\nopposite, and the widths of\nroads and roundabouts are\nlimited by the width of the\nbuildings, and cannot easily be\nrelated to the volume of traffic.\n\nEXERCISE\n\nTo dismiss Motopia for these\nreasons would, however, be to\nmiss its real point. For Motopia\nis an exercise in the imagina-\ntion, and opens our eyes to the\npossibilities that have still to be\nexplored in landscape and town\ndesign.\n\nThe greater part of the book\nillustrates the historical devel-\nopment of the urban landscape,\nwhich Mr. Jellicoe wishes to\nrestore to the place it held in\nthe 18th century when town and\ncountry were brought together\nin the Bloomsbury squares.\n\nWe shall not find the answer\nto the motor-car problem by\nhacking the city to pieces to\nmake way for it in unlimited\nnumbers.\n\nWe must begin by designing\nfor people, by setting our archi-\ntects and their professional col-\nleagues to work to design a new\nkind of town in which we can\nlive civilised lives, using the\nmotor-car without being en-\nslaved by it.\n\nIf “Motopia,” which is richly\nillustrated and simply written,\njerks some politicians, council-\nlors or the long-suffering victims\nof the rush-hour out of their\nwhile.\n\nDAILY\n13 APR 1961\nHERALD\n\nReading 3\nMisc\n\ndown and out\n1983 - 5236 / 44010"

WHILE HE WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SUBMARINE. THE FIRST SUBMARINE construction BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WAS RECORDED IN 1800 BY THE AMERICAN ROBERT FULTON. WHO WAS COMMISSIONED BY NAPOLEON TO BUILD A SUBMARINE TO DESTROY THE BRITISH FLEET. FULTON CALLED IT THE \"NAUTILUS\". AND IT WAS A GOOD SUCCESS FOR THE TIMES. THERE HAD BEEN EARLIER EXPERIMENTATION WITH SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION, BUT FULTON'S CONSTRUCTION. WHEN IT WAS RECORDED, IT WAS THE MOST ADVANCED. FULTON WAS SUCCESSFUL AT THE TIME AS HE WAS ABLE TO CONSTRUCT A SUBMARINE THAT WAS ABLE TO GO FORWARD. AND ALSO TO GO BACKWARD. AND IT WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ENEMY TO HAVE DETECTED IT. THIS MADE FULTON'S SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION RECORDED AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL.\n\nTHE SUBMARINE WAS LAUNCHED IN 1800. AND IT WAS ABLE TO GO UNDERWATER FOR AN HOUR AT A DEPTH OF 10 FEET. THE SUBMARINE WAS 16 FEET LONG AND 4 FEET WIDE. IT WAS MADE FROM WOOD AND WAS COVERED IN LEATHER. THE SUBMARINE WAS PROPELLED BY MEANS OF A HAND-CRANKED PROPELLER. AND IT WAS ABLE TO CARRY SIX MEN. THE SUBMARINE WAS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A FIREARM THAT COULD BE FIRED UNDERWATER.\n\nFULTON'S SUBMARINE WAS A SUCCESSFUL DESIGN FOR ITS TIME, AND IT LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR FUTURE SUBMARINE DEVELOPMENT.

THE SUBMARINE WAS PROPELLED BY MEANS OF A HAND-CRANKED PROPELLER. AND IT WAS ABLE TO CARRY SIX MEN. THE SUBMARINE WAS ALSO EQUIPPED WITH A FIREARM THAT COULD BE FIRED UNDERWATER.\n\nIN 1801, FULTON USED HIS SUBMARINE TO SINK THE HMS HERSAM, A BRITISH SHIP, IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL. THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME THAT A SUBMARINE HAD BEEN USED IN WARFARE. THE SUCCESS OF THIS OPERATION CAUSED THE BRITISH TO DEVELOP THEIR OWN SUBMARINES. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO SUCCEED IN THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT OF THE SUBMARINE. AND FULTON'S SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION WAS RECORDED AS THE MOST SUCCESSFUL.\n\nTHE GERMANS STARTED USING SUBMARINES IN WORLD WAR ONE. AND THEY NAMED THEM U-BOATS. THE U-BOATS WERE VERY SUCCESSFUL IN SINKING ALLIED SHIPS. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DESTROY ALMOST ALL OF THE BRITISH FLEET. BUT THE ALLIES DEVELOPED NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO COUNTER THE U-BOATS. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO WIN THE WAR. THE SUBMARINE HAS BEEN DEVELOPED MORE AND MORE EVER SINCE.\n\nTHE FIRST SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION RECORDED BELIEVED TO HAVE BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL WHILE THEY WERE ALL RELATIVELY EARLY.\n\nBY THE 1800S, SUBMARINE TECHNOLOGY HAD ADVANCED TO THE POINT WHERE THE SUBMARINE BECAME A VIABLE WEAPON OF WAR. THE FIRST SUBMARINE TO BE SUCCESSFULLY USED IN COMBAT WAS THE CONFEDERATE SUBMARINE H. L. HUNLEY, WHICH SANK THE UNION WARSHIP USS HOUSATONIC IN 1864. THIS EVENT MARKED A TURNING POINT IN NAVAL HISTORY, AS IT DEMONSTRATED THE POTENTIAL OF SUBMARINES AS A WEAPON OF WAR.\n\nTHE TECHNOLOGY OF SUBMARINE CONSTRUCTION CONTINUED TO ADVANCE RAPIDLY THROUGHOUT THE LATE 19TH AND EARLY 20TH CENTURIES. BY WORLD WAR I, SUBMARINES HAD BECOME A MAJOR FACTOR IN NAVAL WARFARE. THE GERMANS EFFECTIVELY USED THEIR U-BOATS TO INTERRUPT ALLIED SHIPPING, ALMOST BRINGING BRITAIN TO ITS KNEES.

It\nis done with a piece of paper about three inches\nsquare. This paper is folded twice, once in each\ndirection, so that it forms a small square. This is\nthen placed in the mouth. When it is taken out\nagain, it has become a perfectly formed flower.\nThe effect is produced by the way the paper is\nfolded and manipulated.\nThe spectator is asked to take a piece of paper\nfrom the spectator and place it in their mouth.\nWhen they remove it, it will be seen to have\ntransformed into a flower.\nIt is best to use a good quality paper for this\ntrick, as it will be more durable and will not tear\nas easily.\nThe paper should be folded into a square. The\ncorners should be brought to the center of the\npaper and then folded again. This will create a\nsmall square. This is then placed in the mouth.\nWhen it is removed, it will be seen to have\ntransformed into a flower.\nIt is a very easy trick to perform, and it is sure\nto impress any audience.\nThe Trick\nTake a piece of paper, approximately 3x3 inches.\nFold it in half, then in half again, so it becomes\na quarter of its original size. Place this folded\npaper in your mouth.\nBlow gently on the paper while it is in your\nmouth. This will cause the paper to expand and\nform a flower shape.\nThe paper will open up and become a flower.\nIt is a very simple illusion, but it is very effective.\nThe spectators will be amazed at how a simple\npiece of paper can be transformed into a flower.\nThe Trick Explained\nThe secret to this trick is the way the paper is\nfolded. The paper is folded in such a way that\nit can be expanded to form a flower shape. The\npaper is also treated with a substance that will\ncause it to expand when it is blown on. This\nsubstance is not harmful and is safe to use.\nThe paper is then placed in the mouth, and the\nspectator is asked to blow on it. This causes the\npaper to expand and form a flower shape.\nThe result is a beautiful flower that is sure to\nimpress any audience.\n\nThe trick of the paper flower can be done with a piece of paper, and the hands.\nThe paper is folded in half, then folded in half again.\nThen, the paper is unfolded so that it forms a square.\nThe corners of the square are then folded to the center.\nThis is done with all four corners.\nThe paper is then folded in half, and then in half again.\nThis creates a small square.\nThe paper is then placed in the mouth, and the\nspectator is asked to blow on it.\nThis causes the paper to expand and form a flower.\nThe paper should be treated with a substance that causes it to expand.\nThis substance is not harmful and is safe to use.\nThe flower is then given to the spectator as a souvenir.\nThe trick is very easy to perform, and it is sure to impress any audience.\nThe paper should be of good quality, as it will be more durable and will not tear as easily.\nThe trick should be performed with a piece of paper about three inches square.\nThe paper should be folded twice, once in each direction, so that it forms a small square.\nThis is then placed in the mouth, and when it is taken out again, it has become a perfectly formed flower.\n\nThe Buddy, Bill & Tommy's",

        "Transcribed_Text": "SIR HUGH CASSON took a sheet of paper\n        from his conference documents and did\n        a lightning sketch. There it is above—his idea\n        of a seaside pier \"for motorists only,\" where\n        the whole family can spend a car-based day\n        enjoying the ozone.\n        Sir Hugh, the eminent architect, had just given his\n        ideas about a new seaside, made-to-measure for the\n        motorist, to the people most concerned—200 represen-\n        tatives of British seaside resorts. They were meeting\n        in London.\n        They may have thought\n        his ideas fanciful. But he is\n        practised in making his\n        dreams come true.\n        He was chief architect of\n        the Festival of Britain.\n        \"These car piers,\" he told his\n        audience, \"should be like the\n        conventional seaside pier, out at\n        sea on legs and reached by a\n        causeway.\n        Exciting and\n\n        Expensive\n        \"They would have two- or\n        three-storey viewing decks for\n        cars only.\n        \"They need not look unsightly\n        —on the contrary they could\n        look most exciting. They would\n        be expensive, or indeed an\n        multi-storey garages on land,\n        but at least there are no expen-\n        sive site costs to meet.\n        \"If the pierhead amenities in-\n        cluded such obvious facilities as\n        cafes, souvenir shops, lavatories\n        and the like then the motorist\n\n        By FRANK\n        DAWES\n\n        would not grudge an ap-\n        priate charge.\"\n        He told me afterwards\n        he picked up the idea\n        Chicago, where a car pier is\n        being built over the lake to solve\n        the parking problem.\n        He also suggested the two-\n        storey promenade—one level for\n        vehicles, the other for strollers.\n        Sir Hugh agreed that the\n        piers were perhaps suitable only\n        for large resorts. He wanted a\n        complete ban on motor-cars in\n        the smaller resorts.\n        Motor cars\n        defined\n        But before his piers get under\n        way he asks for an immediate\n        policy of charging for prome-\n        nade parking at all resorts.\n        After all to the car-borne\n\n        holidaymaker the car is more\n        than a vehicle, he said.\n        \"It is a home base—\n        • The place to which the\n        family returns for meals.\n        • To put the baby down for its\n        afternoon sleep.\n        • For sun-bathing.\n        • Where the children change\n        in and out of bathing things.\n        • Where Granny snoozes all\n        day over her knitting.\n        • Or of the pick-nick: a teenage\n        daughter, tuned into Radio\n        Luxembourg, sits daydreaming\n        on her shoulder blades and\n        brooding over the injustices of\n        her life.\n        And the men from Blackpool,\n        Brighton, Bognor and Broad-\n        stairs and all the resorts in the\n        alphabet laughed and ap-\n        plauded Sir Hugh's devastating\n        description of a typical seaside\n        town today.\n        It rung bells.

He sold it for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1,000 in 1899.\nWilgar and his wife Ann lived in the house until they were too old to get around at 85 and 75 years.\nThey were the staff of Cains-cross brewery in 1957 when Mr Harvey was 70 and his wife was 60.\n\nLIFETIME\nMiss Jean Park and her sister Isobel lived in the house all their lives.\nIt was built of a fine, handcut stone and had 20 acres of land. The total value was Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£1,500. Miss Park told me, \"It was my fathers.\"\nThe brewery was not in operation in 1968, when Mr John Maxwell came to live in it with his wife Isobel.\nThey moved in from Ireland when Mr Maxwell retired from the services. He was 57 and she was 50.\nMrs Maxwell told me they had been looking for a place in Scotland that would be out in the country.\n\"We saw about 12 houses and none of them pleased us,\" she said.\nThen she saw an advertisement for the brewery in the Dumfries Standard.\n\"We came down, saw it, and bought it,\" she said.\n\"We liked the stone, it was beautiful. The size was suitable for us.\"\nThe Maxwells had two children, a son and a daughter, but they were grown up.\nTheir son David Maxwell, a doctor, was in the RAF, and their daughter Janet was married with three children.\nThe Maxwells told me they had no plans for brewing, but they had a still and a vat.\nMr Maxwell said he made his own wine.\n\"It is a hobby,\" he said.\nHe had retired with the rank of Group Captain.\n\n\"I'm the only person left alive that has lived in the brewery, after all the brewers.\"\nIt was bought in 1968 by Richard Smith, an electrical contractor from Manchester. He was 30 years old, and had a wife and four children. He had plans to use the building as a store for his electrical business. He told me, \"It's a hobby. I'm going to turn it into a store.\"\nHe had worked in the family business all his life. His father was still living in 1968. He was 50, and his wife, Jessie, was 47.\n\nTOO BITTER\n\"Some people say whiskey is too bitter, but it's not. If you put too much peat in it, it can be bitter. It's a question of taste.\"\nWhiskey, a hop concentrate, was the last brew produced at Dalbeattie Brewery, which closed down about 20 years ago.\nThe brewery was built in 1840, and the last brew was made in 1948. It was a beer that was called \"Dalbeattie Beer.\"\nThe hops came from a hop farm in Kent. They were boiled and then put into the fermentation vats. The process was called \"brewing.\"\nThe brewery was owned by a local man, and it was a family business. The owners were called the Maxwells.\nThe brewery was sold in 1968, and the new owner was a Mr Richard Smith from Manchester. He had plans to use the building as a store for his electrical business.\n\nCHEERS\n\"It's a hobby, brewing is an art. It's not a science.\"\nA brewer told me, \"It's all about taste. You can make it as bitter or as sweet as you like.\"\nHe said he had been brewing for 40 years. He had started when he was 20. He had been brewing beer all his life. He had been brewing beer for 40 years. He had been brewing beer for 40 years.\nHe was 60 in 1968, and his wife was 57. He had two children, a son and a daughter.

J. Regan,\nAnglican Bishop of Newcastle,\npreached to the crowds on\nThe steps at the Cat-\nhedral.\nThe Rev. Dr. Simon\nBrothers, Rector of Carlton, an-\nnounced the formation of a fund\nto buy land on which the\nhomeless could set up homes.\nHe said the fund had already\nbeen approved by the City\nCouncil. The State Govern-\nment must be pressed to pass\na special Bill to allow the fund\nto build on the land.\nThe Bishop said: \"It is a\ndisgrace in the eyes of the\nnation that such large numbers\nof people are homeless and\nsleeping under bridges or in\nthe open.\"\nThe extended march took\nabout four hours. Many\npeople were exhausted and\nlooked relieved to find\nshelter in hundreds who\nstood outside in the gather-\ning darkness.\nMany old and young were\nalso visible in homes who\nhad no home or shelter for\nthe Christmas season. This\nincluded families and mar-\nried couples.\n\nREMEDIES\nAnd he suggested three ways\nthe problem could be solved:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n\nland in some Melbourne sub-\nurbs to build homes. This\nwould save the homeless\nfrom having to move to the\noutskirts of the State and\nbuild their own homes on\nblocks of land up to 10\nacres.\nDESPERATE\n*This is not just about\nthe homeless of Melbourne\nbut is a Christmas issue.\nThousands of people in\nVictoria have no home, no\nshelter to go to on Christmas\nDay, so it is a matter of\nlife or death for some.\"\nThis is the last chance.\nThe next three weeks will\nsee many Christmas concerts\nand fundraising functions,\nbut a homeless man's eye\nis going to be empty.\n*Mr. J. Smith, 45, said: \"I\ndon't want to make the 1st of\nJanuary the 2nd. If I haven't\nfound a home by then, I will\nbe homeless. I've been out\nof work and unable to get a\njob for six months. I've got\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£100 and want to make a life\nfor myself. I need a home to\ndo so. I can build one for\nmyself if I can get the land\nto do so. I've got a lot of\nfriends who will help me. I\ncan be admitted for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£5 a week\nand make a life for myself. I\ndon't need any more than\na house for my family.\n*A spokesman for the City\nCouncil said: \"The City Council\nhas approved the fund. We\nare looking at a site for the\nhomeless. We will have a\nmeeting at the end of the\nweek to discuss it. We will\nlook for a suitable site. We\nwill look for a suitable site\nin the suburbs. We will look\nfor suitable sites. We will\nbe looking for suitable sites.\nWe will be looking for suitable\nsites in the suburbs. We will\nbe looking for suitable sites\nin the suburbs.\"\n*He said: \"We have to be\ncareful. We don't want to\nupset the residents of the\narea. We don't want to upset\nthe residents of the area. We\nhave to find a place where\nthe residents are happy.\"\n\nC.

Isn't the\n        present emergency as grave?\n        Among his other suggestions\n        were mobile homes in London\n        parks and open spaces, and the\n        requisitioning of empty houses.\n\n        DESPERATE\n        As the bishop finished his ser-\n        mon, 28-year-old Mrs. Gwyneth\n        Cleaver, mother of two children\n        who is living in an LCC centre\n        apart from her husband, said:\n        \"This is our last desper-\n        ate hope—that this march\n        will move someone's con-\n        science. Christmas isn't\n        going to be much fun for us.\"\n        Later, Dr. Stockwood, said: \"I\n        don't want to make this an anti-\n        landlord thing. It's a question of\n        human cupidity. We're all guilty\n        of that—all ready to make a bit\n        of money where we can.\n        \"What really sticks in my gul-\n        let is the fact that a single room\n        in, say, Hampstead, without\n        facilities—water or anything—\n        can be offered for £5 a week to\n        desperate people.\n        \"And they are forced to take\n        these rooms.

He is seen\non the way to the \"Barrel\nMonks\" at the Churchills.\n\nBY LESLIE DOWD\n\nWilliam Ripley\ninherited his job from\nhis grandfather, who was an\nassistant at Churchills.\nThere are few of us\nwho can say that we are in\nthe direct line of descent\nfrom men who held the\nsame job 500 years ago, but\nWilliam Ripley, of\nChurchills, can.\n\nonly a monk's bad temper\nand a nasty disposition\ncould save him from being\nlocked in the barrel.\nBut it didn't happen for the\nnext 12 hours - not until\nafter his prayers and his\nblessings from the Prior\nhad been said in the\nChurchill Brewery - where\nthe traditional Barrel\nMonks ceremony was to\ntake place one last time -\nbefore the 500-year-old\ncustom was to be banished\nfor ever.\nThis last ceremony was to\ntake place on Christmas\nDay.\n\nTHE LAST\n\nThe tradition began when\nthe monks of Churchill\nAbbey produced the beer for\nthe village and for the\nabbey itself and, with it,\nthe brewery became one of\nthe most important of the\nabbey's many assets.\nThe abbot of Churchill Abbey\ndecided that the best way\nto see the brewery kept in\norder was to appoint a\n\"Barrel Monk\" - a monk who\nwas responsible for\ninspecting the beer barrels\nto see that they were kept\nin good condition and that\nthey were filled in the\nproper way.\nAt Christmas Day, the\nBarrel Monk had to drink\na barrel of beer in front\nof the whole village - and\nif he was unable to finish\nit, he was locked in the\nbarrel for 12 hours.\nThis was not always a bad\nthing, as the monks could\nget very lonely, and after\na night's drinking it was\nnot too hard for them to\nfall asleep for 12 hours.\nBut there were also some\nmonks who just could not\ntake the taste of the beer\nand the barrels could be\nvery draughty, and William\nRipley's grandfather told\nhim that he had heard of\nmonks being half-frozen\nwhen he had to stay in the\nbarrel overnight.\n\nTRADITION\n\nAt a Christmas Day meeting\nthe monks elected the man\nwho was to be the Barrel\nMonk for the next year. It\nwas a much sought after\njob - not because of the\ndrinking - but because it\nmeant that the Barrel Monk\nwas not allowed to talk to\nanyone for 12 hours of the\nday in the brewery and had\nto live a quiet life, so he\ncould concentrate on his\nprayers.\nBut the job is being done\naway with as the brewery is\nbeing taken over by a new\nowner from Sheffield, who\nis bringing modern methods\nand equipment. He will also\nbe bringing new beer. And\nthe monks are very upset.\nThey have petitioned their\nBishop and he has been in\ncommunication with the\nowner to try and preserve\nthe ancient custom - but\nto no avail.\n\nPUBLISHED\nJAN 17 1950\nRECEIVED\n\n7 3/8\" wide\n7\" DEEP\n\n10.7. 7949\n\nRICHIE - EASTEND\n\n15-10x8\n70 F",

I will transcribe it as \"UNION JACKS\".\n\nCorrection: \"UNIONS JACKS\" is indeed what appears to be written. The 'S' is fairly clear. It's unusual usage though. Let me re-examine.\n\"UNION JACKS\" makes more sense in the context of one flag. It's \"UNION JACKS\" because the word \"Jacks\" is plural. If it was one flag, it would be \"Union Jack\".\nHowever, later text says \"Mr. Nudd pointed to a Union Jack\". This creates a contradiction.\nLooking at the text again, \"UNIONS JACKS\" - the 'S' is quite distinct from the 'N'.\nBut then \"Mr. Nudd pointed to a Union Jack\". This indicates a single flag.\nIt's possible the original text was \"Union Jacks\" referring to more than one flag, or a typo, or refers to the members of the union who were acting like \"jacks\" (in the sense of common people or perhaps a playful term for police/officials). Given the context of a flag, it seems like a misprint or typo.\nFor precise transcription, I must transcribe what I see. I see \"UNIONS JACKS\".\nHowever, the later reference \"Union Jack\" is singular.\nLet me zoom in further on \"UNIONS JACKS\".\nThe 'S' is definitely there after 'NION'. \"UNIONS\".\nSo I'll transcribe what's there.\n\nAnother look at \"Totham Sidcup\". It looks like \"Tothon\" or \"Totham\". \"Totham\" is a place name, so is \"Sidcup\". It's possible.\nThe line above \"See also Ailton NUDD\" is indeed \"Totham\" and \"Sidcup\".\nThe purple stamp \"AGENT\" appears twice.\nThe handwritten \"colx4/8\" deel\" is distinct.\nThe inverted daily herald stamp should be transcribed as it appears on the image, even if inverted.\n\nLet's re-verify the full inverted stamp text.\nAND MUST BE RETURNED TO THE PROPERTY OF THE DAILY HERALD LIBRARY\n27 JUL 1948 DAILY HERALD\n\nOkay, I believe I have captured all elements.<ctrl95>1983-5236/44440\n\n                                                    AND MUST BE\n                                        RETURNED TO THE PROPERTY OF THE\n                                                    DAILY HERALD LIBRARY\n                                                                    HERALD\n                                                                27 JUL 1948\n                                                                    DAILY\n\n                        AGENT\n\n        Mr & Mrs A J.

M. C. Hodson, decided the church was too crowded. He called in police to clear it.\nThe Dean, who is a member of the Government's Working Party on Homelessness, said he did not want to see anyone sleeping in the Cathedral.\n\"We must keep the Cathedral for services only,\" he told a journalist.\n\"I am afraid that it is not possible to allow people to sleep here.\"\nMr. A. E. M. Sanderson, national secretary of the LIM, which had organized the march, said 2,000 homeless had joined in.\n\"We wanted to draw public attention to the desperate plight of the homeless,\" he said.\n\"The march went off very peacefully.

It is a genuine march of desperate people.\"\nBishop of Woolwich, the Rt. Rev. David Sheppard, who joined the march at London Bridge, told the homeless people: \"It is a disgrace to the nation that so many of you are sleeping rough or in dreadful accommodation.\n\"The Government should be ashamed that all of you have to live in these conditions. There are 25,000 homeless people in London.

This would\nincrease the heat stored in the\nground and will not sink below\n65 deg. even in winter.\nThis house is composed to 500\ncu ft. per person.

These units are\nlighting radio, etc. Each unit\nis composed of a type of hot\nwater radiator which contains a\npump in the radiator. This\nis then connected to the\nradiator in the kitchen.\nA heat pump type of radiator\nwas in Mr. Capps bungalow in\n1938 and proved a success.\nA solar heating system, using\na pump, has been in operation\nfor five years.",

But they spend it on \"gourmet\" on luxuries\n\nWhat wish it so that their families can have a higher standard of living than that to provide a more secure and, if possible, a more prosperous existence for the childrean, and if a reliable source of their labour, they will never fail them.\n\nWhat you are looking at now, Mrs.\nElizabeth Murry, aged 35, from\nRochdale, Lancashire, who is doing\nout the jobs in the factory. She is\na mother of two children, and she\nsays \"I am doing a job for the benefit\nof the family.\" Mrs. Murry is earning\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£3.2.0 a week, which she uses for\nthe general expenses of the family.\nMrs. Murry said that she was looking\nfor a job, which she could do after\nthe children had gone to school.\n\nNOT AN ESCAPE\n\nIt is not an escape from the ordinary\nroles of women, but rather an\nenhancement of them. What is\nbeing learnt here, the women are\nalso doing, and their husbands are\nalso doing. The factory is a place\nwhere women can find the skills and\ntraining that will give them the\ncapacity to lead a richer, fuller life.\nThe men who are working in the\nfactory are also found to be very\nsupportive of their wives. Mrs. Murry\nsaid that her husband, who is a factory\nworker himself, is very proud of her\njob and encourages her in every way.\n\"He knows that I am doing this for\nthe family, and he is happy that I\nam contributing to our lives,\" she said.\nThe benefits of this system are also\nseen in the children, who are reported\nto be well-adjusted and happy. The\nwomen in the factory are also found\nto be very supportive of each other,\nand they often share tips and advice\non how to balance their work and\nfamily life. The factory has also\nintroduced a creche service, which\nallows mothers to bring their children\nto work with them. This has been\na great help to many mothers, as it\nallows them to have a job without\nhaving to worry about finding\nchildcare.\n\nMrs. Mary Davies,\n1960-2158-1",

He is a member of the pit consultative com-mittee, an apprentice training officer, and he does not like to miss a day's work.\n\nBut he—and many others of his age—are finding one thing.\nBY JOHN DODD\n\n£10 10s. a week. It is too big a drop from the £19 I get for five shifts at the coal-face.”\n\nIn his 42 years down the mines he has lost three close friends in accidents, and nearly died in one himself.\n\nYesterday, when he should have been working, he sat in a club with other miners, drinking pints and telling stories. Why\nweren't the others working? One woke up late, two were on holiday, and two more were suffering from “bumps” and were off sick.\n\nToday Mr. Bressington will be back at work. “Back with the 'donkeys' and the machines.”\n\nLast week Lord Robens, the Coal Board chairman, con-demned absenteeism in the pits as a “national malaise.” He said that voluntary absen-teeism cost the Board the equivalent of 27,000 men's work last year.\nThey cannot keep up the pace. His union secretary, Mr. Bryn Williams, says: “In the old days a man was on the scrap heap at 45 but he could do his work at his own pace. Now he is expected to keep up with a machine until he is 65.\n\n“They took the horses out of the pits and left the donkeys.” The “donkeys” at Cwm are men—numbering 1,400. Accord-ing to Mr. Williams more than 100 wear belts to support slipped discs in their backs, and 400 are suffering from dust, ranging from 10 to 60 per cent. dis-ability.\n\nEXCUSE\n\nHe would rather smother his grandchildren than let them go down the pit.\n\nMr. Bressington says there are several reasons why men don't go to work on Mondays.\n\nSome have to get up at 4.30 am. to travel 10 miles to the pit; some are fed up with chang-ing jobs down the pit. Others, like him, are feeling the pace of trying to keep up with machines.\n\nAnd there are those who, if they miss a shift, earn as much from the sickness and compen-sation benefits. He says the best excuse is an accident down the pit.\n\nWORST\n\nCwm Colliery's absentee figures are among the worst in South Wales. Yesterday 27.8 per cent. of the overall staff failed to turn up, something like 400 out of 1,400.\n\nProduction at the colliery averages 26 cwt. per man-shift, compared with a national aver-age of 34. The geographical conditions are partly to blame.\n\nMr. Bressington works behind a coal-cutting machine, pump-ing up hydraulic pit props and shovelling coal on to a conveyor. He says: “I could ask to do lighter work. But for pushing\ncoal I would get only\n\nINDUS. FUEL. AND POWER. COAL.\nMINERS . . . MISC . . ."

Those councils that\nadminister the Small Dwellings\nAcquisition Act, which deals\nwith this matter, should pro-\nperly give priority in the grant-\ning of building licences to men\nworking on the land.\nThe farm worker who is a\nmember will find that his\nunion is always ready to help\nhim deal with the formalities.\n\nThe kitchen—light, modern,\nwell-equipped.\n\nB.

He\npointed out that any buyer would\nhave to be prepared to demolish\nthe block and replan it. This, he\nsaid, would be a considerable\nexpense.\n\"The Ministry is obliged to build a\nstation at Marylebone,\" he said.\n\"This site is considered the most\nsuitable. We are at present\nnegotiating for the demolition\nof the office block, which was\nbuilt about two years ago. A\ndecision will have to be made by\nthe end of October.\"\nThe Minister is to meet the\nleader of Westminster City Council\ntoday to discuss the matter. The\ncouncil has been assured that\nany building erected by the Ministry\nwill be designed so that it will\nhave no adverse effect on the\nsurrounding buildings, and that\nthere will be no objection to its\nerection.\nThe Ministry is understood to\nbe prepared to pay compensation\nto the original builders, but this\nfigure is not yet known. The\noriginal builders were Messrs. Walter\nSmith (Contractors) Ltd., of\nWalworth. They completed the\nblock in April, 1966.\nThey are thought to have built\nthe block for a figure of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£200,000\nto Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£220,000, and it has been\nstanding empty ever since.\nThe block has been standing empty\never since.\nINDUSTRIES- BUILDING- GEN",

In the Korean War: There is a 4-inch-thick\nsteel plate, 12,000 feet deep in the Pacific Ocean, where a team of\nrecently lost U.S. Navy and C.I.A. ships together with an Israeli\nsubmarine are searching for a missing U.S. Navy sub. The USS SCOTCH\nTAPE, a nuclear submarine. The sub vanished more than two years ago\nin an area known only as \"The Dragon's Triangle\", a location notorious\nfor all the ships that have gone missing there for all time, and no\none knows what happened to them or the \"Scotch Tape\" or the crew of\n129 men. It is believed to have been hit by a falling meteorite, which\napparently left a very long gash in the ocean floor that could lead\nto the Earth's core. Most likely it was hit by another force, more\nlike the \"The Bermuda Triangle\" force, but no one on \"The U.S. Scotch\nTape\" would ever believe that, it was known to travel everywhere, and\nthese incidents were known to cause a catastrophic atmosphere, but no\none, absolutely no one, ever understood, sort of what it was and what\nthey did to them. No men or vessels or aircraft have ever been found.\nAnd now there is a team searching for them but they have not found\nthem at all. What makes this so mysterious?

All the\nother 99 pullets pecked her.\n\nEFFORTLESS\n\nCame Esther's turn to chirp\nwhen Mr. John Plummer, the\n30-year-old farmer and his\npretty 24-year-old wife Ann,\nan ex-Land Army girl, put\nEsther with the ducks for\nsafety.\n\"When with ducks, do as\nducks do,\" thought Esther\nand in no time she had taken\nto the pool and was swim-\nming as effortlessly as—a\nduck.\nHer feet move in the same\nmotion as the ducks' and\nwhen she needs a rest from\nswimming, up she goes on to\none of her friends' backs—a\ndown-covered raft.\n\nWhen it's time to dry her\nfeathers out, the ducks get to\nwork with their beaks with a\nsystem that must feel like the\nchicken's idea of a Swedish\nmasseur.\nSo Esther's happy in her\npool.

Built on concrete\nstilts and protected by a floating breakwater (seen in the foreground) and\nby a curved 100 foot high city wall, it could be built in any of the shoal\nwaters that exist over 10 per cent of the surface of the ocean.\n\nThe majority of its inhabitants would live in attractively designed and\nadequately serviced flats, as the picture shows. The floating islands\nvisible in the central lagoon, artificially heated by waste cooling water,\ncarry both public and private buildings providing the educational, social\nand cultural facilities required by modern civilisation.\n\nOutside the walls (right-foreground) special articulated container ships\nberth in the \"moat\" of calm water to unload stores, while a hovercraft\nheads for the harbour entrance to discharge its human cargo.\n- end -\n\nIssued on behalf of\nPilkington Glass Age Development Committee\nFebruary 20, 1968\n\nCastlar House\n19 Warwick Row\nLondon S.W.1.\nTelephone: 01-834 5456\nTelex: 23954\nEnquiries: Dick Semps",

This million acres is made up of some\n500 forests, which are well distributed over the length\nand breadth of Britain.

Ransomes & Rapier four\nyears to build on the site. It weighs\n1,600 tons, has electric motors that\ngive over 3,000 motor horse power,\nworks for 20 hours a day, actually\nwalks -- with seven-foot steps -- and\nis controlled by one man. Its purpose:\nto remove strata covering the ironstone\nbed down to a depth of one hundred feet.\nIronstone sells for a little over seven\nshillings a ton; the W.1400 is designed\nto uncover 400,000 tons of it each year.\nFor this reason, huge machine that it\nis, it must \"walk\" over the area. After\nsettling in a spot, the machine swings\nout with the great jib -- an arm 282\nfeet long, the tip of which is 175\nfeet above the ground. Then it drops a\n22 ton scoop, lifts and drags away 27\ntons of spoil. Within 60 seconds, the\nscoop has emptied and is back, digging\nin once more.

To-day, the Forestry Commission and private woodland owners are pressing ahead with the vital task of forming new forests and re-stocking the old. The year 1955 has marked a mile stone in the history of the Forestry Commission, for it has seen the planting by the Commission of the one millionth acre of new woodland. Thus the area of woodland planted to date by the Commission is now more than 1,500 square miles - an area larger than Kent, nearly twice the extent of Glamorgan and nearly two-thirds of Perthshire. This million acres is made up of some 500 forests, which are well distributed over the length and breadth of Britain. In present years, well over 500-million trees - including more than 70 million hardwoods - have been planted annually by the Commission and many of the forests are now producing timber in substantial quantities; in 1955, the total production amounted to 600,000 tons.

Wednesday 4.4.1968, by Sir James Scott, Chairman, J.P., Deputy Chairman of the Glass Manufacturers Federation and Fellow of the Royal Society, of Rockware Glass Ltd., in London. The Four Founders of Rockware Glass Ltd., for the immense success of glass containers in the face of increasing competition from other materials were the nature of the material Ã¢â‚¬â€œ used for display, and liberally shown. The the process were out lined. One of the two main materials: 1. The technology of electrically-powered strengthening and 2. The method of electric-powered shaping. A very colourful film entitled \"Glass Coloured Spectacle,\" which portrays the adventuress of glass manufacture, was also presented today. In the five years since the Glass Manufacturers Federation made their first glass supplier film, which of textiles and yarns have leaped from 40 million units in 1964, to 540 million units last year. \"Rockware Glass.\"\n\nMr James D.

The nature of the material - good for display, and\nclinically clean; 2. The low price per unit, due to low\ncost basic raw materials; 3. Technology - lightweighting\nand strengthening; and 4. The advent of one-trip bottles.\nA new, colourful film entitled \"Glass Coloured Spectacle\",\nwhich promotes the advantages of glass containers, was\nalso premiered today.

The plough can be raised when the tractor\nturns at the end of a furrow, the plough-raising system being\ncut out when other implements are attached to the tractor.\nThe radio-controlled tractor is so much lighter than the\nconventional type that fuel normally consumed in one hour is\nsufficient for a whole day's work.\nPHOTO SHOWS:- The tractor with radio-control apparatus, and\nthe transmitter (on ground in foreground).

REMINDER OF A FORMER INVASION\nTHREAT.\n\nDelving back into history when Europe was dominated\nby Napoleon and England stood on the waiting list,\nthe fine old park lands at Bushy Park, Hampton,\nMiddlesex, were turned over to the needs of agricul-\nture and food production. After that period they\nbecame park lands again up till to-day. Now\ninvasion threatens again and once more food production\nmust be served. To-day, the McKay Massey Harris\nSunshine Binder - new importation to this country\nfrom Australia - is at work on the park lands: gave\ninteresting demonstrations to officials and Dominion\nrepresentatives. Fine oats are being grown on the\nfields which were first ploughed up last November and\ncross-harrowed in March. Yield is now 60-80 bushels p\nper acre. Wheat and barley are also being grown.\nThe new binder, which should prove very satisfactory\nto the English market, has a six-foot cut; refinements\ninclude grease-gun pressure lubrication; gun-metal\nbearings for the packers; enclosed oil-bath for the\nmain bevel gear drive. The big wheel is all metal,\nwood is replaced in the decks by galvanized steel.\nThe sheaf carrier is simplicity itself.\n\nPhoto shows:- The horse team cutting the oats.\nMR. A.R.MANTHYLLOW (Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries)\ncan be seen at back examining the cut.\n\n7/8/40. M. (Topical Press)."

The Things in inflatable\nyellow costumes, tights, beak-shaped\nbonnets and claw-style shoes are\nreally just drama students\nhired by the Egg Marketing Board\nfor a big publicity drive.\n\nThe chickens, pictured in London\nyesterday crossing a road, of course,\nwill call at homes and ask:\n\"Are you eating an egg ?\"\nIf you are, you get a £1 Premium Bond.\nIf you're not, you get (what else?)\nhalf a dozen eggs.\n\nThere do appear to be slight problems\nin the plan, though. The chicks\nwill be very early birds, calling\nat homes at what some people regard\nthe unearthly hours between seven\nand nine in the morning.\n\nAnd so they may expect some\n(pardon the pun) hard-boiled cracks\nat their eggs. Cracks like: \"But\nI went to work on an egg yesterday.\nAnd it broke down in the High Street.\"\nCOPYRIGHT\nFOX PHOTOS LTD\np.3. 80 PLI. 320\n89/91, FARRINGDON ROAD, LONDON, E.C.1\nTELEPHONE: CEN. 7831-6 & CEN. 8702\nRECEIVED\n11 MAR 1966"

It is very hard to combine and it is thick with weeds and grass.\"\n\nExcellent\n\nAt the headquarters of the National Farmers' Union in Knightsbridge, cold statistics tell the story: Somerset, only 30 per cent. of the harvest in. Wiltshire, only 50 per cent.\nSaid an official: \"Men are harvesting in paddy field conditions. The whole harvest is two to three weeks behind.\n\"Even in places like Cornwall, where they have got 85 per cent. of the harvest in, the grain is light and the yield is below average.\"\nThe long-range weather forecast is far from heartening: \"Cool, disturbed and occasional stormy weather. Intervals of more settled weather are likely to be brief. Rainfall totals are likely to exceed the average.\"\nProvisional estimates for the 1965 harvest are considerably lower than last year when the good summer yielded excellent crops.\n\n1965 - 2350 3\nR14 780.\n6 cols x 7 1/2\" deep.\npq. 9-0\n4 1/2 cols x 6 3/8\n\n1983 - 5236 / 40310\n\nIndustry ..

To cope with its capacity of 30,000 barrels, or just over 1,000,000 gallons a day of imported crude oil, it was decided to establish an installation at Finnart, on Loch Long, and run a pipeline from there to the refinery, this being more convenient than using the old Grangemouth Docks exclusively.

For that is the hour at which he has been told by the local council to quit a house owned by his father.\nWest Ham Council wants to put in more tenants at 5, Chatsworth-road, Forest Gate, which it requisitioned in 1940. The last tenant moved out 10 weeks ago.\nLast night 25-year-old Silas was at heavily bolted No. 5. Determined, he said, to stay. And with him were dogs Bambi, a Boxer, and Jack, a Manchester terrier.\nSilas's father, Mr. Charles Bentley, made frequent requests for his son to be allowed to move into the house. To each the council said \"No.\"\nYesterday Silas got on a bicycle at his father's shop in nearby Forest-street and pedalled with his bed on his shoulders to Chatsworth-road.\nBambi and Jack followed him yelping. The Bentley family—mother, father, sister, niece, and nephew—brought up the rear.\nThey carried Silas's provisions for a possible siege—five tins of meat, three tins of dog food, two tins of peaches (\"I'm fond of peaches\"), and four loaves of bread.\nSilas came to a bedroom window to answer questions last night. The dogs began barking. It was two minutes before they stopped.\nWho goes there?\nSilas, a burly, curly-headed, 5ft. 8in. figure, called down, \"Who goes there?\"\nI said I was a reporter. There was no answer. I did not have the password.\nSilas's mother came to the rescue. She stumped round the corner crying \"Cuckoo.\" This was the signal. I walked in behind Mrs. B. The dogs bounded forward. Silas shouted: \"Stop.\" I breathed again.\n\"It is my father's house. I am his tenant, and here I am staying,\" said Silas.\n\"My wife Myrtle, for whom I had no home is coming up from Devon to join me.\"\n\"How long do you think you can last out?\" I asked.\n\"A long, long time,\" replied Silas.\n1955-460-2\nFile: Housing (P.W.) - Misc - Evictions"

Ploughing with an 80-h.p. track-type tractor in 1935 was one of the first ploughing and soil erosion experiments used in Texas. The agricultural engineers are now giving farmers the benefits of the very latest implements. During 1934, they were still using a few years older implements which did not fit the Blacklands very well, although using a field much larger than the average. This field was large and fairly level. One of the greatest problems is erosion by wind and water. The cultivated area has been a level-terraced field for 10 years, and there is a 30-foot drop from the cultivating area to the outlet of the terraces. Nobody knows for certain how the field was levelled, but one man on the county remembers the plowing for not more than 50 years.\nBefore being cultivated by Harley, cultivating the land with a 6-foot lister, was a contract between him and the landowner who will harvest the sorghum and oats by hand. Under the contract, the plowing and terracing of the field was done by the owner or renter. The owner then harvests the field on a wide scale.",

They secured the prefab owing to the\ndanger of the cottage collapsing, and because of its\ndamp and unhealthy conditions.

There is an increasing demand for more, not less, of the services provided at our old people's clubs. The Minister of Health, Miss Edith Pitt, M.P., indicated that voluntary organisations would eventually be in a position to handle the bulk of such services, but that it would be some time before the national scheme was working as she would wish. Even so, the Minister agreed that more of the services, particularly domiciliary home help, might be needed in certain areas.

Although much larger catches are expected at this time of year, owing to the development of the rather elaborate \"jam-nut fishing\" system, which was developed over the last 20 years, the Eider River has been experiencing rather light catches this season. Jam-nut fishing is a method of catching fish by means of a string of bait, which is cast out into the river and then drawn in by means of a pulley. The bait is generally composed of fish spawn, but other forms of bait may also be used. The jam-nut fishing system is rather elaborate, and it is said to be quite effective in catching fish. However, it is also said to be quite difficult to learn, and it is not recommended for beginners.\n\nParis Champs.

The lightweight home, which may play an\nimportant part in the solution of Britain's housing problem, was\ndesigned by the Aircraft Industries Research Organisation on Housing,\nand built by the Bristol Aeroplane Company, of Weston-super-Mare,\nSomerset, and is called the Airoh House. Electrical fittings are\ninstalled when the sections are constructed, being plugged in to the\nmains after assembly, which can be completed in four hours. Production\nof the Airoh House in aircraft factories ensures continuity of\nemployment for skilled workers in aluminium, hitherto employed on\nmaking parts for aeroplanes, besides meeting a national demand for homes\nto replace those destroyed in the war.\nPHOTO SHOWS:- Lowering the third section of the aluminium house into\nposition on the bombed site.

ANDERSON\n\"A car, holidays\"\n\nWIVES go out to work first and foremost because they want the money.\nBut they do not usually need it for basic necessities. Nor do they spend it as \"pin-money\" on themselves.\nThey want it so that their families can have a higher standard of living than is possible on one wage alone. And if a conflict arises between the claims of their jobs and the interests of their families, they put their families first.\nThis new evidence on the con-troversial subject of working wives and mothers is put for-ward today in a report published by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research.\nIt is based on a study of mar-ried women workers, sponsored by the DSIR, and carried out by social scientists from the London School of Economics under Professor R. M. Titmuss, at the Peek Frean biscuit factory in Bermondsey, London.\nAt this factory, three-quarters of the 4,000 workers are women—most of them married, more than half of them with children. Few work the full 10-hour day. Most are part-timers on shifts of 4, 5 or 6½ hours.\n\nNOT AN ESCAPE\nThe investigators found that for most wives \"work was un-dertaken as a means of helping the family, not as an escape from it.\"\nTwo pay-packets in the family mean that more can be spent on refurnishing the home, on more varied food, on pocket-money and toys for the children, on a small, second-hand car or on a proper family holiday.\nThough many wives said they would miss the social contacts if they did not work, their first loyalty was always to their families.\nThe biscuit factory—abandon-\n\nBy JOYCE CHESTERTON\ning its pre-war bar against married women because of the labour shortage — has done much to make it easier for wives to work.\nThe 9.30 a.m.-4 p.m. shift, for instance, consists mainly of mothers with school-age chil-dren. They can leave home and get back at the same time as their families.\nMothers with under-fives work mostly in the evening, when husbands are at home to take over and put the children to bed.\nWithout considerable help from husbands, in fact, most of the wives would find it very hard to cope with both job and home.\n\nTERRY FINCHER\nWORKING HOUSEWIVES REPORT.

For seventy-six-year-old Mr. Wallis, chairman of the National Cricket Association, it has been a rewarding one. The veteran umpire, who has been making cricket bats for the past sixty years, says that the demand for his handcrafted cricket bats is really just starting. The 120-acre estate, which is owned by the United Dominions Trust, is being converted into a holiday resort for the Australian cricket team, who are here on a tour of the island. The villa, the centrepiece of the estate, is a magnificently preserved Georgian mansion, and is said to be the largest privately owned house in Britain. The estate will also feature a golf course, a swimming pool and a tennis court. The cricket ground itself is also being renovated, and a new pavilion is being built. The resort is expected to open its doors to the public in the spring of next year.\"",

AW/O\n\nSteel works are usually associated with South Wales or the industrial North, but it is a surprising fact that the steel foundry with the largest output of carbon or plain steel castings in the country is situated at Letchworth, Herts, only 30 miles from London. It provides employment for 1,500 work-people, many hundreds of whom have migrated from the North and distress areas. The work on hand is for a variety of industries ranging from ship building and locomotives to Power stations and cigarette machinery. The flow of steel means a flow of prosperity to thousands of homes in Hertfordshire and it is hoped to find employment for several hundred more by the end of 1937.\n\nPhoto shows-      A striking picture of a steel converter in action, by which molten iron is converted into steel at the Letchworth foundry.\nFox Jan 6th. 37.\n\n6,TUDOR STREET,\nLONDON, E.C.4.\nTEL.CEN.7831\n5 LINES\n\nUSED -7 JAN 1937\n\nIndustrial\n-South\nWhen the furnace roars and the sparks fly there is a touch of fiery beauty, even in that most practical of industries-a modern foundry.
